#####Recursive technique: When and how to use it?
  
One of the techniques of solving programming problem is _divide and conquer method_, divide the problem into sub-problems, sovle the sub-problems and combine the result to get the solution of the original problem. Recursion is such technique based on such principle, where solution of the problem is based on the solution of the smaller instances of the same problem. Most of the languages support recursion by allowing function to call itself. Such technique is the core to functional programming as such technique encourage immutability. On other hand, an oppositing technique is iteration, which is core of many imperative languages supported by using structures like for or while.
